# Set up pstack

> Originally by [poteto](https://github.com/poteto) for [Cursor pstack](https://github.com/cursor/plugins/tree/main/pstack). Adapted for Hermes Agent.

In this page you install the plugin, pick which models pstack uses, and run your first task. Setup is one command plus a short conversation.

## Install the plugin

Install via the Hermes CLI:

```text
hermes plugin add pstack
```

Hermes confirms the plugin is installed.

## Pick your models

Load the setup skill:

```text
load pstack:setup-pstack
```

[`pstack:setup-pstack`](../../skills/setup-pstack/SKILL.md) detects the models you have access to, asks for a reasoning budget, shows you each role (code delegates, judgment, the review panels), and asks what you want. Answer the questions. It writes model routing configuration that every pstack skill reads.

You only override what you care about. A role with no override keeps the skill's default. To restore a default later, remove that role's override, or just run `pstack:setup-pstack` again.

You might be wondering what happens if you use Auto. Set a role to `inherit-parent` or `auto` and pstack omits the delegate_task `model` field, so the delegate inherits your parent chat model. Both values mean the same thing, and neither is a model slug. For a panel role the value is a list, and one delegate runs per entry, so the list length sets the panel size. Setup also configures `swarm workers`, the default model for every `pstack:swarm` worker unless a race names a model for each arm.

## Accept the verification offer, or don't

At the end of setup, `pstack:setup-pstack` looks for a way to prove app behavior in your project, either a `verify-*` skill or an existing harness. If it finds neither, it offers once to generate one with [`pstack:create-verification-skill`](../../skills/create-verification-skill/SKILL.md).

Say yes and it writes a project-local skill that teaches agents to drive your app the way a user does. It proves the skill works once before handing it over. Say no and setup moves on. You can run `pstack:create-verification-skill` yourself any time. [Verify and ship](./06-verify-and-ship.md#create-a-project-verification-skill) covers when it earns its place.

After setup, start a new chat. The model configuration applies to new sessions.

## Run your first task

Pick something real but small, and describe it the way you'd describe it to a colleague:

```text
load pstack:poteto-mode add a --json flag to this command. text output stays byte-identical. verify both.
```

Watch the todo list. Its first items are the matched playbook's steps copied in, the Feature playbook for this prompt. If `pstack:poteto-mode` skips a step, the step stays in the list with `skip: <reason>`, so you can see what it chose not to do.

From here you can type normal follow-ups. `pstack:poteto-mode` is sticky. It stays on for the conversation until you opt out by saying so.
